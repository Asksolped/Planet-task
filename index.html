          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is
          orange-red because it is covered in iron oxide dust, giving it the
          nickname "the Red Planet". Mars is among the brightest objects in
          Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a
          common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified as a
          terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's
          planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital
          motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours, and a
          Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars
          has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape:
          Phobos and Deimos.

          Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the
          Noachian period (4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago), Mars's surface was
          marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible
          presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period (3.5 to 3.3â€“2.9 billion
          years ago) was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding
          that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which
          continues to the present, has been marked by the wind as a dominant
          influence on geological processes. Due to Mars's geological history,
          the possibility of past or present life on Mars remains of great
          scientific interest.

          Scientists have theorized that during the Solar System's formation,
          Mars was created as the result of a random process of run-away
          accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the
          Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its
          position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling
          points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are much more common
          on Mars than on Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by
          the young Sun's energetic solar wind. After the formation of the
          planets, the inner Solar System may have been subjected to the
          so-called Late Heavy Bombardment. About 60% of the surface of Mars
          shows a record of impacts from that era, whereas much of the remaining
          surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those
          events. However, more recent modelling has disputed the existence of
          the Late Heavy Bombardment.
